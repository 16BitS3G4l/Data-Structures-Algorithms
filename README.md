# Data-Structures-Algorithms
This repository contains my implementations of popular data structures and algorithms. Additionally, I store the solutions (and problem statements) of coding problems I've encountered. These problems vary by difficulty, but they're typically from these sources: 
1. [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)
2. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
3. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
4. [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
5. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

### Table of contents: 
Data Structure Implementations: 
1. [Stack Data Structure](https://github.com/dev-segal/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/Stack/stack.py)
2. [Queue Data Structure](https://github.com/dev-segal/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/Queue/Queue.java)


Algorithm Implementations: 
1. [Selection Sorting Algorithm](https://github.com/dev-segal/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/Sorting/selection-sort/SelectionSort.java)
2. [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/dev-segal/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/FibonacciSequence/CalculateFibSequence.java)


Programming Problems: 
1. [Does Sum (of pairs) Exist in List?](https://github.com/dev-segal/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/Daily/easy/ProblemOne.java)
2. [Multiply other elements, except element i, and place at position i](https://github.com/dev-segal/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/Daily/hard/ProblemTwo.java)
3. [Serialize/Deserialize Binary Tree](https://github.com/dev-segal/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/Daily/medium/ProblemThree.java)
- The deserialization was a really tough one for me, it took a couple of days. I had some trouble because of the way I decided to format nodes, like so: 
(NodeValue, (LeftNode), (RightNode)) It felt natural to solve it with a recursive algorithm, but it still had a few hoops to jump through.
